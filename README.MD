Why Should I Use Mesh?
----------------------

With so many alternative music services, what makes Mesh so much better? I've compiled a list of pros and cons for Mesh below:

|             Pros             |                Cons                |
|:----------------------------:|:----------------------------------:|
| No Ads (not even banner ads) |           Still in Alpha           |
|    Supports many platforms   |        Unpolished interface        |
|   Extensible/Hackable Code   |   Some servers require a Beta Key  |
| You can host your own Server |   May be buggy in some instances   |
|        Unlimited Skips       | No Internet Explorer Compatibility |
|  No monthly limits/song caps |    Currently only one developer    |
|      27-36 Million Songs     |    Varying Quality (Usually HD)    |
|   On-Demand Song Streaming   |                                    |

|    Extreme Customization     |                                    |

How can I use it?
-----------------

Your either going to need to get a invite code for an existing server or host one yourself. Here's how to do the latter:

1. __Clone the project__: Either run ```git clone https://github.com/taconut/mesh``` or Extract the zip manually. I personally reccomend the using git clone, since you can run ```git pull``` to update when there are changes. 
2. __Install Dependencies__: Mesh also requires [FFMPEG](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) (and obviously [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org)). Most online Node.JS services have these preinstalled, so you only need to worry about this if you're working on a local computer.
3. __Install NPM Modules__: Run ```npm install``` and wait for all of Mesh's dependancies to install themselves into node_modules. Most errors should be pretty self-explanitory, but feel free to open an issue if something doesn't work right. I won't judge; I promise.
4. __Rename buildoptions__: Make a copy of buildoptions.sample.env called buildoptions.env. If you're working in a public environment and do not wish to store these options in a file, you can also inject them directly as environment variables. 
5. __Add API Keys__: Below, I've provided a list of places where you can get various API keys needed by Mesh.
  + [The Echonest](https://developer.echonest.com/account/register)
  + [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/api/account/create)
  + [Youtube](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/) 
6. __Setup a user database__: For the time being, Mesh only supports mongo. There are plenty of free services for using Mongo databases.
7. __Setup an email service__: For email recovery and verification to work, you're also going to need an email account. Gmail should suffice, but there are other options available if you need them. If you're using Gmail, you need to log into your Gmail account and enable support for legacy automated logins via [this link](https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps).
8. __Add a Session Secret__: Your going to need a value for SESSION_SECRET. Try to use something that people would have a relatively hard time guessing (so not "secret").
9. __Create an admin account__: The first account you create will have admin privlages. Go to /user/signup to create your admin user. You can leave the "invite code" section blank since there are no invite codes yet .
10. __Add invite codes__: Right now, invite codes are mandatory. You can add them by going to /admin/key/__CODE__. Additionally, you can supply a number of uses and expiry date. Refer to the [Admin Reference Page](../../wiki/Admin) for more information.

How does it work?
-----------------

+ Currently, Mesh retrieves most of its music from YouTube. However, I plan to supplement this with other sources in the near future.  
+ Mesh is heavily reliant on [The Echonest](http://the.echonest.com) to build a profile of your taste in music. In future versions of Mesh, more of this work will be done locally.
+ I'm using [Last.fm's API](http://www.last.fm/api) to retrieve the album art, since that seems to have by far the most amount of content available

What Platforms does it support?

+ Chrome
+ Firefox
+ Safari*
+ Android*
+ iOS*
+ Squeezebox*
+ Windows**
+ Mac**
